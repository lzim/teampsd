    Hi Dr. Das,
    <br> <br>
    Thank you for meeting with us yesterday.  Looking forward to January, the next meeting with the MD team would be 
    <b>Tuesday, January 9th at 8:15am</b>.  Does this date/time work?  Also, the first link at the bottom of the page takes you to the data tool while the second link will take you to
    the Guide page where you can find a video called "Data Details, Fixes, and Questions."  This will walk you through
    how to use the data.

    <br> <br>    
    Let me know if you have any questions!
    
    <br> <br>
    Thanks,
    <br>
    Stacey
