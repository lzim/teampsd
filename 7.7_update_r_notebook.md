**R Notebooks enlist 2 API Tokens**

1. Use Lindsey's GitHub lzim/research account for an API token (Team PSD folder > Vendors).
2. Request a REDCap API token (IRB approval & VA REDCap approval is required first, the token will expire after 90 days.
3. Install R, R Studio, & GitHub desktop on your VA GFE by opening a Your IT helpdesk ticket.
