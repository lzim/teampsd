**Annual reports**, **user story mapping**, and **annual reviews** (processes to make progress).
- Reports and reviews are like what we learned from Patton's User Story Mapping book,

**Family vacation photo**
- They are just documents reflecting important processes to achieve key goals.

**Annual Report:**
- What matters is that we make _continual progress_.

**User Story Mapping:**
- Last quarter before report we ask what else would we really like to include.
- The report itself is just the documentation of the entire year.

**Annual Review** 
- What matters is that we set goals and work together to achieve them.
- **Quarterly 1:1s* and **coach_chat** are used to get specific support related to you thriving in your role (your P.D.).
- **Coach chats** are mini-check-ins related to the 4 Ps.

_The 4 Ps_
- Project
- People
- Process
- Pattern

_Team-level:_ **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** - work _flows_ delivering our value streams.

_Team-member level:_ **S.M.A.R.T.** - personal & professional goals.
