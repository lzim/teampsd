 *Cross-reference: [#343, Story A2 & A3 Submit R01 & IIR IRB Mods](https://github.com/lzim/research/issues/343)

1. Check ReadMe (R21, R01, IIR) for anticipated Renewal Date and ensure user story maps plan a feasible approach to any updates.
2. Principle Investigator adds R&D to eProtocol as Admin Contact.
3. Confer with all workstreams to identify any changes in staffing or methods on the protocol.
4. R&D & DataOps review anticipated modifications with PI at team_time or mixed_methods or quant_research workflow meeting no less than 2 weeks before submission.
5. R&D creates modification on eProtocol.
6. PI reviews and approves (future state: R&D).
    - *DataOps makes DART and VINCI modifications after IRB approval (when necessary).*
