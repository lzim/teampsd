 *Cross-reference: [#343, Story A2 & A3 Submit R01 & IIR IRB Mods](https://github.com/lzim/research/issues/343)

1. Check ReadMe (R21, R01, IIR) for anticipated Renewal Date and ensure user story maps plan a feasible approach to any updates.
    **Research Repo for R21:** [R21DA042198](https://github.com/lzim/research/tree/master/r21DA042198#readme)

    **Research Repo for R01:** [1R01DA046651](https://github.com/lzim/research/tree/master/r01DA046651#readme)

    **Research Repo for IIR:** [I01HX002521](https://github.com/lzim/research/tree/master/i01HX002521#readme)

2. Work with Dr. Craig Rosen & PI to set up your [Stanford SUNetID](https://accounts.stanford.edu/).
3. Principle Investigator adds R&D to eProtocol as Admin Contact.
4. Confer with all workstreams to identify any changes in staffing or methods on the protocol.
5. R&D & DataOps review anticipated modifications with PI at team_time or mixed_methods or quant_research workflow meeting no less than 2 weeks before submission.
6. R&D creates modification on eProtocol.
7. PI reviews and approves (future state: R&D).
    - *DataOps makes DART and VINCI modifications after IRB approval (when necessary).*
