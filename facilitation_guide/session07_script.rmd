# Session 7: Medication Management, Part 2
## FACILITATOR PREP & FOLLOW-UP

### Overview
In this session, we walk through the flows and feedbacks related to ________, ________, and _________ in the Medication Management model. This model enables you to experiment with how team decisions about referrals, time allocation and visit frequency impact the quality of medication management for patients.  Your team can explore scenarios to balance these tradeoffs and better meet the specific needs of patients with depression, alcohol use disorder and opioid use disorder.  Insights from this model are designed to increase local reach of evidence-based pharmacotherapies.
