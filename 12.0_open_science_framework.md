# Instructions to Authors

We use several platforms to ensure co-authors can easily track the progress of a manuscript, communicate about next steps, and seamlessly co-write asynchronously. Before diving in, please check out the flow charts below on how to contribute based on your role. Please review the section below on how we use the Open Science Framework to manage our manuscript development.

**Standing Office Hours: #manuscript_monday 12:30-1:30 p.m. PT** (3:30-4:30 p.m. ET)

1. [https://mtl.how/manuscripts](https://mtl.how/manuscripts) is the _tracker/Kanban_ for manuscript submission.
2. [https://mtl.how/osf](https://mtl.how/osf) is the _registry/platform_ for developing manuscripts and making data available per NIH requirements.
3. [https://mtl.how/authorship](https://mtl.how/authorship) is the R Shiny Application we developed for determining authorship based on a) prior_work using developers categories or b) writing using the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) & American Psychological Association (APA) guidelines.

## Access the Authorship APP

1. [mtl.how/authorship](mtl.how/authorship) We use the Authorship App to ensure a fair & transparent process for assigning authorship order. The app tracks what work has already been done, who has made intellectual contributions & in what subcategories, and how to divvy up the remaining work.
2. You will receive an email from the TeamPSD Shiny Server, giving you access to the authorship app. If you do not have this email, please email [mtl.info@va.gov](mtl.info@va.gov) and request access.
3. Once you get the email granting access, click on the link within the email. This will take you to the page below. Click on “Login”.
4. This will open up the Login/Sign Up pop-up below. You can either use an existing Google/GitHub account to login or sign up for an account.
5. In the future, you can go directly to the [mtl.how/authorship_app](mtl.how/authorship_app) and login from there. Once your computer starts to cache your login info, you may be able to skip the login step altogether.

## Track Completion and Contributions

1. Co-authors can use the app asynchronously to provide:
2. How much prior work (or intellectual contributions) for a manuscript have already been completed: What percentage of the manuscript is based on work previously done vs. writing and analyzing that is still left to be done?
3. Prior work contributions made by each co-author:
    - What intellectual contributions have you made to the topic of this manuscript and which TeamPSD workgroups do those contributions fall under?
    - Who are the other co-authors that worked on those contributions with you?

## Add Co-authors

1. With the co-authors on your manuscript decide and add to the app:
2. Based on the prior work weights averaged across all the co-authors provided input, how will we divvy up the remaining writing, editing, and analysis?

## View Progress

As you fill out the weights for a manuscript, a series of pie charts will show the division of contributions for that manuscript to help you work already assigned, authorship order, and work to be assigned.

## Use Open Science framework (see below)

**We use the Open Science Framework to co-write the manuscripts asynchronously with built-in version control for tracking changes.**

- Make sure you can log into [mtl.how/osf](mtl.how/osf). If you don't have an account, please create one.
- Reference instructions on how to use the OSF in the [TeamPSD Manual](https://lzim.github.io/teampsd/3-standard-operations.html#manuscript_tracker).

## Use Lucid Charts for Figures and Tables

TeamPSD pays for an organizational account with LucidCharts, which allows us to track version history and communicate asynchronously on documents. Please email  mtl.info@va.gov with your preferred (VA or non-VA) email address to use with LucidCharts. Once you are added, you will get an email that walks you through the rest of the sign-up process.

## Use the Manuscript Tracker in GitHub

- If you are creating a new account or re-activating an old one, please send your username to mtl.info@va.gov, to be added to our TeamPSD repository. Once you are added, you will get a second email asking you to confirm this change.
- Read more about the manuscript tracker in the TeamPSD manual [TeamPSD Manual](https://lzim.github.io/teampsd/3-standard-operations.html#manuscript_tracker).
- **Note: GitHub is a public platform. Maintain standard VA compliance guidance and do not post any PHI/PII. Do not post any direct manuscript content including drafts, figures, etc.**

## Open Science Framework

Team PSD is using [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://mtl.how/osf) to work on drafts and related manuscript materials.
OSF also shares the same values of supporting open-source, transparency, and a reproducible workflow just like Team PSD.
