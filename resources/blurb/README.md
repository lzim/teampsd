TeamPSD, or Participatory System Dynamics, is a group of scientists, skilled partners, and VA leadership that aim to increase Veterans' access to timely, high-quality mental health care, under the guidance of Dr. Lindsey Zimmerman, a clinical and community psychologist and implementation scientist. The team developed *Modeling to Learn* (MTL), a national program consisting of three components: virtual facilitation ([MTL Live](mtl.how/live)), transparent local data ([MTL Data](mtl.how/data)), and real-time simulation ([MTL Sim](mtl.how/sim)). MTL strives to increase the reach of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in VA outpatient addiction and mental healthcare by bringing local leadership, providers, scientists, and policy makers together with mutual learning, shared decision making, and equitable access to resources. Our team uses a free, transparent, reproducible, and open data science workflow disseminated on [GitHub](mtl.how) to build our models, resources, and guides.
