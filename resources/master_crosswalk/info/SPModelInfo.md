| Variable name | iText |
|--------------:|:------|
|**GMH** | **UI Variables**|
GMH Care Quality|Quality care has many dimensions, but in this module we are mainly concerned with how quality impacts the time it takes patients' symptoms to improve; specifically impacting the variables "Time to Improve" and "Time to Unflag."  A shorter time implies faster recovery. 
GMH Community Care Patients Reduce Effort|Patients seen in the community take less effort than a typical patient, but not zero effort.  We estimate that 5 patients seen in the community take the same effort as one patient in care in VA.
GMH Effect of Patient Load on Ability to Detect Symptom Changes|As workload increases, the ability of providers to detect symptom changes decreases, and vice versa.  This effect directly impacts the variable "Time to Detect."  This effect is limited to 3x, as the highest load could not do more than triple the original Time to Detect.  There is no limit to the positive effect decreasing workload has on providers' ability to detect symptom changes.
GMH Effect of Patient Load on Care Quality|As workload increases, the quality of care provided by a team decreases, and vice versa.  This effect is limited to 2x, as even the lowest workload could no more than double the original quality of care (i.e., no more than halve the current Time to Improve and the Time to Unflag). There is no limit to the detrimental effect increasing workload has on care quality, and could (potentially) drive "Time to Improve" and "Time to UnFlag" toward infinity. 
GMH Effect of Patient Load on Manageable Total Patients|If workload experiences a sustained increase, eventually the total patients the setting can manage decreases, due to provider fatigue and burnout.  This effect seeks to represent both small changes (providers taking more sick days) and large changes (providers quitting entirely) in supply.  The effect can only go below 1, as below-average workload cannot increase supply.
GMH Effect of Patient Load on Start Rate|As workload increases, the ability of providers to start new patients decreases, and vice versa.  This effect directly impacts the "Patient Start Rate."  This effect seeks to represent the physical reality of having a schedule that is too full to start new patients.   There is no limit to the detrimental effect increasing workload has on start rate -- a high-enough workload could cut patient starts to zero.
GMH Effect of PC/PCMHI Wait Time on Recommend Step down Rate|As wait times to step down to PC/PCMHI increase (both for GMH patients who transfer and those who start in PC/PCMHI without leaving GMH), GMH providers will be less willing to recommend that their patients step down.  There is no limit to the detrimental effect PC/PCMHI wait times have on GMH step down recommendations; however, this effect is limited to a maximum of 1.5x, as very low wait times could increase step down recommendations by no more than 50% over the original rate. 
GMH Effect of SMH Wait Time on Recommend Step up Rate|As wait times to step up to SMH increase (both for GMH patients who transfer and those who start in SMH without leaving GMH), GMH providers will be less willing to recommend that their patients step up.  There is no limit to the detrimental effect SMH wait times have on GMH step up recommendations; however, this effect is limited to a maximum of 1.5x, as very low wait times could increase step up recommendations by no more than 50% over the original rate. 
GMH Effect of Wait Time on Start Rate|As wait times into GMH increase, GMH providers will feel more pressure to start new patients.  This effect is limited to 2x, as even the highest increase in wait times could only double the original patient start rate.
GMH Ending Rate|The number of patients who completely end mental health treatment in this setting each week (i.e., who are not starting in another mental health setting to continue the same episode of care).
GMH High Risk Flag Patients|All patients in this setting who currently have a High Risk Flag.
GMH High Risk Flag Patients Extra Effort|Patients with a High Risk Flag take extra effort (both in terms of time and complexity) than the average patient.  We estimate that seeing  one patient with a High Risk Flag takes the same effort as providing care for two average patients. 
GMH High Risk Flag Rate|The number of patients in this setting who receive a High Risk Flag each week.
GMH High Risk Flag Stepped Care Rate|The number of patients transferred in from other settings with a High Risk Flag each week.

GMH High Symptom Patients|All patients in this setting currently with high symptoms.
GMH Improvement Rate|The number of patients who transition from high to low symptom each week.
GMH Low Symptom Community Care Rate|The number of low symptom patients who start care in the community each week.
GMH Low Symptom Patient Detection Rate|The number of early in care patients who are found to be low symptom each week.
GMH Low Symptom Patients|All patients in this setting currently with low symptoms.
GMH New Patient Start Rate|The number of patients recommended to start in this setting each week, who are not transferring in from another setting (i.e., they are either enitrely new to mental health care, or are seeking to start concurrent treatment while remaining in a different setting).
GMH Patient Load|The ratio of the total number of patients seen in GMH over the manageable total patients (i.e., demand over supply).
GMH Patient Start Rate|All patients who start in GMH each week, regardless of whether or not they have left their previous setting.
GMH Patients Early in Care|All patients in this setting who have just started care, where the provider has yet to settle on a specific treatment plan or whether or not the patient is "high" or "low" symptom.

GMH to PC/PCMHI Recommend Step down Rate|The number of patients who are recommended to step down to PC/PCMHI each week.
GMH to PC/PCMHI Step Down Rate|The number of GMH patients who start in PC/PCMHI each week.
