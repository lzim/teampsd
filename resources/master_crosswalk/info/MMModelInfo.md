| Booking Rate                                                         | The booking rate combines demand from both existing patients (based on appointments on the calendar and the scheduled RVI) and new patients' first appointments.

| Completing Rate                                                      | Appointment completions are based on the team either satisfing all the demand from existing patients (based on appointments on the calendar and the scheduled RVI) or using all the supply (based on the Appointment Supply).  If there is more demand than supply, then not all scheduled appointments will be seen in a timely manner, and Actual RVI will increase.  This is different from a completed visit, as the appointment is still complete even if the patient no-shows.

| Effect of "Other MM Tasks Time" on Missed Appointments               | When the team uses overtime, they have less time available for important, but non-patient-facing care tasks  (e.g., appointment prep, charting, follow-up, reminder calls).  The more overtime a team works, the greater this effect, and the more the missed appointment rate will increase, compared to the norm.  This effect only applies to overtime: working lower than the official work hours does not influence providers or patients to come more regularly to their appointments. (pct)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Effect of Wait Time on Referrals                                     | When the wait time to start medication management increases above the target wait time for patients with a specific diagnosis, referring providers will be less likely to refer a new patient with that diagnosis.  This effect only applies to above-target wait times:  lower than expected new patient wait times do not increase referrals above the norm.  (pct)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Measured versus Actual Time                                          | This represents the relative change in time available for non-patient-facing care coordination tasks (e.g., team coordination, patient reminder calls, chart review and other appointment prep) consumed by overbooking patient visits.  Additional appointments overbooked onto the schedule come directly at the expense of these tasks.

| Sensitivity of Changes in Other MM Tasks Time on Missed Appointments | This controls the magnitude of the effect changes in time for non-patient-facing care tasks has on missed appointments.  A value of "zero" implies that there is no relationship between overbooks and missed appointments. A value below 1 indicates that patients are not sensitive to small changes in non-patient-facing task time; a value greater than 1 indicates that patients are very sensitive to small changes. Example: if a team is putting in 20% more hours per week than their official supply, then an exponent of "1" would indicate that the ratio of missed appointments to all appointments would also be 20% higher than before. A value of "0.5" would cause that same 20% increase in hours worked to have less of an effect (causing only a 9.5% increase in the missed appointment percentage).  A value of "2" would cause that same 20% increase to have a greater effect ( raising the missed appointment percentage by 44%). |
| Sensitivity of Referrals to Wait Times                               | This controls the magnitude of the effect increases in new patient wait time (or decreases in target wait time) have on referrals, where referrals drop as wait time increases (or the target wait time decreases).  A value of "zero" implies that there is no relationship between wait time and referrals.  A value of "1" indicates that if  the new patient wait time doubles (relative to the new patient wait time goal), then referring providers will cut their care coordination referrals in half.  For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would result in less of an effect (reducing the referral rate to 71% of its original value), and a value of "1.5" would result in a greater effect (reducing the referral rate to less than 35% of its original value).                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Slots Allocation (with X waiver)                                     | The % of the team's total appointment slots allocated to each diagnosis, for clinics where the provider has a DEA X-Waiver. These values replaces the base case value, which is calculated from the team's data. Any set of percentages is possible, but they must sum to 100%.

| Slots Allocation (without X waiver)                                  | The % of the team's total appointment slots allocated to each diagnosis, for clinics where the provider does not have a DEA X-Waiver. These values replaces the base case value, which is calculated from the team's data. Any set of percentages is possible, but they must sum to 1. For providers without X-Waivers, they should not allocate any time to OUD treatment, thus the value for the third % should always be zero.

| Target Wait Time                                                     | The average new patient wait time acceptable to referring providers.  This replaces the value estimated from the team's data.

| User-defined True Missed Appointments %                              | The proportion of total appointments that are missed and rescheduled (i.e., rework). This value replaces the base case value, which is estimated from the team's data. Allowing different entries for each primary diagnosis assumes that the team can target their efforts to reducing missed appointments on particular cohorts.

| Use Team Data for Starting Rate                                      | This switch controls if the number of new patient starts per week is based on either, 1) the remaining appointment supply after all existing patients are seen, or 2) team's historical new patient start rate, where "Off" = if all existing patients can be seen at the desired RVI, then only start new patients in the remaining appointment slots. "On" = start new patients based on the team's hsitorical average rate, even if there won't be enough supply to see existing patients at the desired RVI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
