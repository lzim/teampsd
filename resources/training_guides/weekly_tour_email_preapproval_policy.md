### Process to Change Regular Tour
- [ ] Any scheduled changes to the regular Team PSD tour require written approval in advance by Dr. Zimmerman (i.e. a text message is not sufficient). 
- [ ] Prior written approval applies to all types of leave - Vacation, Sick, Jury Duty, Bereavement and Leave of Absence.
- [ ] If approval is granted, changes need to be reflected in ADP with the appropriate code - this only applies to PAVIR employees.
- [ ] For PAVIR employees detailed information on leave policy can be located in [Employee Handbook](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/rita_2020_04_22_weekly_tour_request_change/resources/training_guides/2017_employee_handbook_pavir.pdf)
