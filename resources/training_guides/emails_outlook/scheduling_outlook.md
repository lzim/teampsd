## Scheduling Outlook Invitation

- [ ] 1. On your own calendar, click on **New Meeting** in the top left.

- [ ] 2. In the **To** section: add all meeting attendees by email including Lindsey.  
**Note**: If Lindsey is traveling or teleworking on the day of the meeting, include her gmail.

- [ ] 3. In the **Subject** field: Create a title descriptive enough for anyone to know what the meeting is about. Include the first & last name of main attendees involved & relevant context of the meeting (i.e. "Connect w/Jane Doe for TeamPSD Mentorship).

- [ ] 4. In the **Location**: Audio: 1-800-767-1750, 27379; Screenshare: mtl.how/live

- [ ] 5. In the **Time** section: Double check that everyone is available in the time window specified.  
**Note**: Double check that Lindsey is not walking/driving to a another meeting before/after the one you are scheduling. If so, she needs buffer time.

- [ ] 6. In the main **Body** of the email: Give context of meeting & re-write meeting details included in the "Location" section earlier. Include timezones (i.e. PST) when specifying times as many partners are not in the same time zone.

- [ ] 7. Make sure to call the **VANTS** scheduling line (304-262-7600) to schedule the call you just made.
