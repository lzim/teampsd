## Quick Checklist:

_There is no checklist provided for this module._

#### Common Mistakes:

1. The most common error on this page is to forget to click the Check button after entering text.  This is very discouraging, especially with longer paragraph.  Recommend editing text in MS-Notepad or related word processor prior to uploading into text fields.

2. There are many errors associated with graphics files:

   - The graphics file has the wrong extension in the name.  For example, the name says samplefile.jpg, when it is really samplefile.png. 
   - The Admin did not upload the graphics file into the correct directory on Epicenter.
3. Admins will attempt to add more days to a demo account after the account has expired.
4. Admins will forget to update the course code in the course_code.xlsx spreadsheet.
5. Admins will incorrectly enter the course code in the course_code.xlsx spreadsheet. 
6. When a Demo user account expires, they must be removed as an End User from Epicenter before they can re-register.
