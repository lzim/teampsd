## Point of Contact: Stacey Park

## Full Instructions
Note: If you need instructions on how to download Adobe Connect or Share Screens go to the [guest_login.md](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/training_guides/mtl_how_live/guest_login.md) module.


**1. Login as a Host**
- Type "mtl.how/live" in any search bar and open up the Adobe Connect app.
- At the login screen, click on "Registered User"  
![](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/sop_training/resources/training_guides/mtl_how_live/login.png)  
- Type in the username and password for the TeamPSD Adobe Connect Host account (this information can be found in the TeamPSD folder)

**2. Manage Attendees**
- In the "Attendees" pod in the right hand side, under "Host" you should see "Lindsey Zimmerman" (yourself). If there is more than one person logged in using the team account at the same time, there may be "Lindsey Zimmerman 1", "Lindsey Zimmerman 2", etc. You know which one you are because the text will be *italicized*.  
In this pod, you can also change the status of any attendee by hovering over them to "Make Host" or "Make Presenter" or by click and dragging their name under "Host" or "Presenter".

- Any team members not managing the meeting will be logging in as a "Guest". When they do, a request will pop up like below, and the "Host" must select "Allow" to let them join the meeting.

**3. Record Audio & ScreenShare for a Meeting**
- Before you record, make sure you have a webcam. This will be your "microphone". Turn on your microphone by clicking on the microphone button in the top nav bar and making sure it is **green**. Put your phone on speaker and place the webcam close to the phone to ensure good audio quality.

- Click “Meeting” on the top left and then choose “Record meeting”.

- Write a brief description of the meeting contents. Make sure to follow the TeamPSD convention (all lowercase, no spaces). Then, hit Ok.

- A message will pop up in the top right with a red circle to indicate that you are recording. When the meeting is done, click on this red circle, and then Stop Recording.

**4. End Meeting**
- After the meeting is done, take any messages from the "Chat" and copy+paste into the Lucid Chat section. Then, click on the upper right drop down on the pod, and "Clear Chat." We want to keep a record of the chat as folks often send important feedback through there.

- End the meeting by clicking on "Meeting," then "End Meeting." This will boot everyone out of the current Adobe Connect session. It is important to do **End Meeting** instead of **Exit Adobe Connect**, as the meeting room will continue to run and charge resources if we do not end.

**5. Backup Recording in TeamPSD folder**
- Click on "Meeting," then "Manage Meeting" Information.  
![](https://usu.service-now.com/manage-meeting-infomation-link.png)
- This will prompt you to login again. Again, click on "Registered User" and login with the TeamPSD account. This will take you to the Adobe Connect admin dashboard.  
![](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/sop_training/resources/training_guides/mtl_how_live/login.png)  
- Click on "Recordings" at the top. This will show you a list of all the Adobe Connect recordings from our team. Find the one you just created, then click on the drop down next to "Actions" and select "Make Offline."  
![](https://support.automaticsync.com/hc/article_attachments/360001232463/Adobe_Connect_1.jpg)  
- This will prompt a save dialgoue window to pop-up. Save it to the appropriate TeamPSD folder based on your workgroup's workflow.
- Note: The backup will need to run for at a minimum the recording's run-time (if not more) to properly backup. If anyone uses the mtl.how/live meeting room in that time, the backup will have issues. As such, plan when you will start the backup around other workgroups and meetings, who will likely use the platform.

#### Common Mistakes:
1. Make sure to turn on your microphone or else you will get visuals but no audio in the recording.
2. Alert folks to turn off their computer speakers when you are turning your microphone on as this will cause audio feedback.
3. Double check the recording backup once it's done to ensure sound and visuals were properly backed up.
