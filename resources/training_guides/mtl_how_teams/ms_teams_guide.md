# MS Teams
TeamPSD and the VA are both using [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app) as their main communication platform.

TeamPSD is currently using the **Free Version of Microsoft Teams** so the entire team can get used to it as the VA begins to roll it out system-wide between mid-July to early August.  

## Quick Start Guide
To review the basics of Microsoft Teams, check out their [Quick Start Guide](https://www.chorus.co/media/2989/quickstart-guide-to-teams-chorus.pdf).

- Signing In

- Start a meeting or call

- Reply within a message/conversation thread
