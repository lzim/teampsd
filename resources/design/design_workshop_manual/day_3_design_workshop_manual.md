## Day 3: Persona Prototypes

**Summary of Artifacts from Empathesize, Define, Ideate**

**Part I. Position Descriptions (P.D.ʼs):**
- **What did everyone notice from highlighting their roles/responsibilities in their P.D. for coordination/collaboration/communication?**

**Problem Statement from our user POV - Our pain points are because Team PSD doesnʼt scale (empathy).**

**Define:**
- **IMPROVE INTEGRATION for SIMPLICITY: As with all software and technology development, there will be constant change! So, our processes need to be _more fully integrated with GitHub standards_, otherwise we canʼt effectively _collaborate at scale_, or _support our resources at scale_, or _contribute open-science_.**
- **FOR A RESEARCH TEAM, HOW WE SPEND OUR TIME IS NOT OPTIMAL: We focus _too much time supporting MTL in production_, not enough time supporting _Team PSD contributions to science_.**
- **USE THE RIGHT TOOLS FOR THE JOB: Right now, _we rely on peopleʼs discipline and consistency with protocols_…and we are doing our best! But, we should be relying _standard coding workflows designed for cross-functional team contributions and transparency_.**
- **CURRENT TEAM IS CONSTRAINED BY NEED FOR “UPSKILLING:”**
   1. **Micro-level: The process of individual team members learning new skills.**
   2. **Macro-level: _Tectonic shift in the workplace_ caused by technology in which new possibilities can be fully realized only by a modernized workforce.**
- **Take a second look at your P.D. - What if you take a look at it now for platforms?**

**Moving from our ideation personas to our first prototype tests:**

**Proposed Prototype: Continuous Integration (CI), deployment (CD), and documentation on GitHub.**
- Consider ways in which **upskilling to include CI/CD** would help you more _fully flex your Team PSD role and responsibilities_.
- **Donʼt just consider the mental model** that you have of a typical day when testing (**AS IS**) only…weʼre trying to map to our desired “dream team” state…
- So, review your P.D. and consider your “TO BE” state in which you had everything you needed to fulfill your role and responsibilities, but would need to learn new skills.

**Part II. PROTOTYPE Testing with our Team PSD “user” PERSONAS Wednesday - Review at 3PM or 10AM Thursday**

**A. PERSONAS:We developed 6 Team PSD user personas:**
- **Sim UI/Model Developer (James)**
- **Quant Data Engineer/SQL Programmer (Ash)**
- **Quant Analyst/Technical Writer (Anthony)**
- **HQ Platform Manager (Stacey)**
- **HQ Research Assistant (Jenn)**

**NOTE: We are Missing Personas for key Part-Time Team Members by Role** (most effective workgroup to partner):
- **Mentee** (e.g., Alexandra?) - HQ
- **Qual** (e.g., Kathryn?) - HQ
- **Co-I** (e.g., Rachel or Shannon?) - Quant pay attention to...
- **Facilitator/Educator** (e.g., Jane or Debbie?) - Sim UI/Model

**PROTOTYPE TESTING with User Cognitive Interview**

**B. PROTOTYPES: We are completing the first 3 GitHub Lab Trainings on #1220 as Team PSD “users:”**
1. GitHub **Apps** (~ 1 hr) - automate repetitive tasks
2. GitHub **Actions** (~2 hrs) - templates workflow with testing
3. GitHub **Packages** (~30 minutes) - continuous deployment

**Part III. TESTING**

**METHOD: COGNITIVE INTERVIEW (_Can you use transcription to “walk through” outload?_ - consider your eyes, mouse, clicks, thoughts, feelings and search behaviors) - We are interviewing ourselves about _two things_ the training and the tools.**

**A. TEST 1: Can I (as this user-persona) use this GitHub training to learn how to use this?**
- How am I using this training? What do you mean?
- What do I understand?
- What is confusing?
- What is frustrating? Why?
- What else did I (or would I) need to look up or check to understand this?
- How much more training will I need to implement this?
- How much help will I need to implement this for my own needs?
- How do I feel?
- Do I like this?
- Is this realistic?

**_Why is this an important user test of the native GitHub Continuous Integration Prototype?_**
- **The more Team PSD enlists existing native GitHub capabilities:**
  - **The easier it will be to onboard new team members**, because
    - New team members will already have used these standards.
    - New team members can “google” and learn for themselves using existing resources.
    - Existing team members wonʼt have to develop those trainings.
  - **The easier it will be for existing team members to help ourselves.**

**B. TEST 2: Can I (as this user-persona) use this GitHub _capability_ (feature/ function) to improve my daily workflow?**
- How would I use these capabilities to address my most common pain points? What do you mean?
- What do I understand?
- What is confusing?
- What could I set up myself?
- What would I need to still to learn?
- What would I need help from others to do?
- What would be most time-saving about this? Why?
- What would be most time-consuming to learn/implement? Why?
- What doesnʼt this do (or what else would I need?) to improve the quality of my workflow and the quality of my daily work life?
- Do I like this?
- Is it realistic?

**_Why is this an important user test of the native GitHub Continuous Integration Prototype?_**
- **We need to rule in/out which capabilities we will implement to remove pain points.**
   - **Constrain our reboot or retooling to the month of May.**
     - Imagine you lose the dedicated team time and want to be **standard-consistent and as independent** as possible.
     - Picture **3 new team members** starting in June (Data Scientist, Modeler, Health Economist)
   - **Submit R21 Manuscripts to close it out in early June.**
     - How can we meet our **open-science standards for our data pipeline?**
     - When can we achieve it?
     - What do we need to do to achieve it?
- **Support new COVID-19 release by Oct.**
   - Note that this is **_with new team members._**
   - **Consider our other partners that all want to collaborate or help (11+, Iʼm not sure this is all - notice anything about this list?…):**
     - MITRE - Synthea and Simulation Models
     - Google/Harvard - Modeling and AI
     - Duke University - PSD
     - University of Utah - PSD
     - University of Denver - PSD/Re-AIM
     - University of Wisconsin/Harvard - PSD/Engineers in Implementation Science
     - University of Queensland - PSD/Emergency Medicine
     - University of Rochester - PSD/Hospital in Home
     - SUNDIR/Stanford - PSD
     - Mission 401/Primary Care - PSD
     - Supercomputing Clinical Care Pathways - Oakridge National Labs, Berkeley
   - Picture supporting **Modeling to Learn** again sometime during this period...
   - Consider the possibility of **MTL Hawaii** starting toward the end of this period.

**TEST 3. Validate Persona Cognitive Interview results against our Priorities and Open Issue Tasks**
**Thursday Afternoon - Observe and Analyze from your user POV**

**B. Review the May Epic R21 and 1192 & 1220 goals and Sorted List of Open Issues**
- **What we should strive to fully implement in May to get the highest yield improvements in Team PSD workflow.**
- **Where is the biggest bang for your userʼs [motivational] buck?**

**C. Which workflow should we set up/implement first** (adds the most value, improves the most downstream; analogy our root level directory)?
- Why is that the most important workflow to set up first?
- Why would it save the most time in May?
- Why would it save the most effort in general (typical day)?
- What paint points does it address?
- What part of the SOP/Manual/Document tracker does it address?
- Is it “root” enough to avoid rework?
- What are the downstream benefits of starting with this?
- What are the risks of starting with this?

**D. _How might we_ set up that workflow? Who needs to learn what?**
- Plans for learning by user-type/workgroup based on the highest yield (for lightest lift):
- What is standard and we can learn it using existing trainings online?
- What needs to be sorted out next to integrate this into Team PSD?

**Friday - Synthesize**
- **Refine plans for divvying up learning and set up tasks to implement Team PSD-specific prototypes for user-testing next week.**
- Weʼll use our Personas to develop Team PSD-specific Tests of our workflow.
