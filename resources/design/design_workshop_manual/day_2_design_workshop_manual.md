## Day 2: Team PSD Manual Workshop Artifacts

**“Gandy Dancers” process for building the railroads**
- Used **song** to lay and adjust track and build the railroads.
- We are working to develop our Team PSD **processes** (song) for building our railroad (not building the track), our **processes** and **platforms** for building. Like a **song**, it should keep us in time w/one another and feel good!
- In this metaphor, the **“train”** is our **mission** to improve care for Veterans. We will have to **learn** to better use our platform to support this mission.
- **Takeaway: We want our platform to support a reliable way of working together** (picture those hammers!)

**GitHub will continue to be our song (platform) for building our railroad because learning to use its standards will scale.**
- **Learning**: Some team members are “unlearning,” some “relearning,” and others just “learning” the GitHub platform.
   - Fortunately, **all** team members have experience learning new platforms to do their work.
- It is already **standard** and
   - used by these current partners:
    - VA
    - Forio
    - System Dynamicists (e.g., James Houghton & Jim Duggan)
   - used by these potential partners:
    - MITRE
    - Google
- **GitHub is already Team PSDʼs standard**, used for 3 years.
- we know how to use **.md**
- we know how to set up **README.md** files
- we know how to use and review **pull requests**
- we know how to complete **issue templates**
- we know how to track and review **ZenHub** reports
- we know how to use **GitHub** more broadly to **develop features**
- we know how to use **GitHub** more broadly to

**Our Team PSD “Works in Progress” repository will be the manual (SOP) for how to contribute to Team PSD.**
**Why?**
- No change: **The Team PSD repo already is our manual.**
- Change: We are not [yet] **configured** to use this repo across the team to meet **all** team members [userʼs] needs at **our growing scale**.
- 45 team members and partners...and growing...
- **How?**
- **GOAL: Keep an eye on “pain points” associated with lack of scale**
- **Metaphor for this goal: We cannot simply “make a table,” when what we need is scalable way for any Team PSD partner to contribute to making of tables that scale.**

**DIMENSIONS of our PROBLEM OF SCALE:**
- **Team: Shared understanding and language** is harder to maintain as we grow beyond our founding team.
- **Partners: Joining the team** is harder unless we use existing standards.
- **Platforms: Maintaining quality in production** is hard to maintain relying solely on individual peopleʼs disciplined adherence to an SOP.
- **Production: Constant change is the norm and improvement desirable**, but hard without means for **continuous integration**.

**Q & A**
**Q:	What is continuous integration?**
A:	Merging all working copies into master several times a day.
Q:	How cool, but donʼt we already do that?
A:	Yes! So we are very close, hereʼs what weʼre missing: **We are relying on people** to provide rapid feedback about defects in our code base, so that they can be identified and corrected ASAP (itʼs not that *fun*, is it?).
A & Q. No. So what would be different if we used continuous integration on our Team PSD Repo?
**A: We will use more of GitHubʼs native (&/or integrated) tools to automate testing and build our documentation.**
##### - These are two things we probably spend over 80% of team time doing by hand...
- So, when thereʼs a missed dependency, which inevitable, because we still struggle to do better than *discover this by hand*...that leads to rework, it hurts!!!
- Our SOPʼs reliance on people leads to social friction, where there could be intellectual friction supported by the right tools.

**OBSERVATIONS that led to this Workshop:**
- e.g., If all team members need to achieve Jamesʼ level of discipline, our SOP doesnʼt scale.
- e.g., If we all to scan the horizon to identify dependencies that our GitHub, ZenHub, Workgroup Leads, Workgroup and huddles still just didnʼt catch, then our SOP doesnʼt scale.
- e.g., If we read through a list of well-specified requirements using the exact same words (e.g., “parser,” “database processes”) and donʼt realize weʼre not speaking the same language, then our SOP doesnʼt scale.
- e.g., If the ask is to create the standard rules for .md files for other team memberʼs to use and we still donʼt understand each other without substantial revision and meeting support, then our SOP doesnʼt scale.
- e.g., If direct dependency intervention from the PI is insufficient for alignment when well-discussed, and well-documented across several meetings and huddles, then our...SOP...doesnʼt...scale...
- e.g., If it takes the team, up to four team members working full time, at any given time to produce the necessary documentation of the changes we made months ago, then our SOP doesnʼt scale.
- Ouch!

**UPGRADING OUR INDIVIDUAL MENTAL MODELS**
**Assumptions about Team PSDʼs need for an improved way of building our railroad through GitHub, we could...**

**OUR SHARED VISION:**
1. **Update** all the files on Team PSD with a key stroke.
2. **Test** scripts instead of use checklists.
3. **Shared (team) or even universal (global) language** so that we all envision the exact same thing.
4. **Integrate data processes**, so weʼre sure about it, including any changes. 5. Provide **seamless transparency** to a whole range of people (and our several team member), rather than do it by “brute force.” 
6. **Facilitate** (empower) checking against standards. 
7. **Manage change** through consistent process.

**HOW?**
- ***How*** **might we (HMW) address our pain points?**
1. **Learn how** to do my job differently on GitHub.
2. **Focus on the benefits** of learning how to better use GitHub as a tool for our purpose.
3. **Discover** and flex GitHub capabilities to scale the “SOP.”
4. **Develop empathic understanding** of each Team PSD memberʼs needs.
5. **Use shared language** so that new changes work for current team members [aka: “users” of the Team PSD repo].
6. **Recruit** new team members and partners with GitHub fluency.
7. **Remember** that we have all learned new platforms before.
8. **Learn from** more skilled GitHub “been-to” team members.
9. **Automate** using complete repository configuration.

**Key to avoiding Potemkin Village: Remember our “users” here are Team PSD Members and Partners, not Modeling to Learn learners.**
1. A Potemkin Village is construction whose purpose is to provide an external facade to hide the fact that its faring poorly.
2. We are **NOT** a Potemkin Village:
   Partners are SO impressed with what we have done making ***Modeling to Learn*** **achieve our 3 participatory principles at scale**: 
    a. Equitable access to resources
    b. Mutual learning
    c. Shared decision-making
    **This is what attracts people to us and makes us stand out the most!**
3. However, **it is ironic to these partners that we are not fully using GitHub for some of itʼs primary purposes**:
   1. **Accessible collaboration tools for parallel management of**
     a. Tasks
     b.Code
   2. **Shared platform for streamlined iterative change (version control)**:
     a. tracking
     b. control
     c. testing
   3. **Support for all programming languages.**
   4. **Easy open source contributions from the community.**
   5. **Documentation.**

**A REALLY KEY IDEA:**

**Consistent with our Team PSD values, we came to our need for GitHub organically. We are further growing into our need for it as a team.**

Tech people, who live and breathe GitHub. Modelers, who live and breathe their models, all want to know how we got to Modeling to Learn? It is impressive they say.
 
I say, “We started with the values and the partnerships and we learned what was needed.” I describe the participatory system dynamics processes we integrated with cutting edge technology, guided by our values to partner with our frontline providers, Veteran patient advisory board, and senior VA stakeholders over the last five years.

We have added two new team members who have experience with the types of enterprise or production level platform we need to optimize our Team PSD skills at scale. Consistent with their Team PSD roles and responsibilities, and their own pain points, they will help the team set up these workflows.

**We will learn this together.**
Our mission and values require it of us.

**We rebooting our “user” focus to Team PSD.**
**Team PSD optimization, not Modeling to Learn optimization.**
