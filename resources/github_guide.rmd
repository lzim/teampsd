# TeamPSD GitHub Guide  

### **Basics of GitHub**  
You can go through the quick guide in the link below. It will teach you about repositories, branches, commits, and opening/merging pull requests.  
https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

### **Style**
We use R Markdown format for syntax and style which you can refer to here (ADD HYPERLINK). Use a human and computer readable format to name files, meaning all lowercase, underscores, and dates (as necesary) with a name that will be meaningful to whoever reads it. For other style guidelines on TeamPSD materials, please refer to (HYPERLINK)  

### **Creating and Editing Files**  
1. To create files, choose the branch or folder you want and click "Create New File."  
2. To view the file's code, simply click "Raw" in the top right corner of the file, next to "Blame" and "History."  
3. To view comments that you/others have added, you can click on "History" and then check for an "ellipses" symbol. This symbol indicates that a comment has been added to the commit. To see the comment, click on the ellipses.

### **Uploading Files**  
To upload files, choose the branch or folder you want and upload the file. The file will be named as it was in your computer, so make sure to give the file a name according that is simple and reflective of its contents to anyone that reads the file name.  

### **Downloading Files**  
Files cannot be downloaded individually - you have to download the entire branch.  You can find the green "Download" button on the main page of each branch.

### **Creating and Editing Branches**
1. Open up the specific file you want to edit.  Create a new working branch and name it using all lowercase, no spaces (use underscores), and your initials - i.e. "facilitation_guide_sp".

2. Make sure you're in the branch you just created instead of the original branch.  Click the pencil icon to edit.  Edit the file and add comments on changes you made.  Click on "Commit".

### **Creating and Editing Pull Requests**
1. Go to "Pull Requests" and click on "New Pull Request". The "Base" branch should be the original branch (most likely "master").  The "Compare" branch will be the branch you created. Click on "Create a New Pull Request".  Add "Reviewers" and click on "TeamPSD" for the "Project section. Click on "Create Pull Request".

2. To add line specific comments, click on "Files Changed".  Hover your mouse in front of the specific line in question and a blue plus sign will appear.  Click on that and add your comment.
