### Create Screencast Video

#### Instructions

Make **user-persona Concurrent Think Aloud videos** testing Team PSD prototypes (aka MVPs: 'minimum viable products').

#### Context - _Why_ this is critical for Team PSD 2.0 to scale?

- To scale Team PSD processes, we evaluate the **usability** and **user experience** of Team PSD prototypes.
     - **Passive Screen Video Observation** 
          - Usability (quantitative MVP tests)
          - This test is the **concurrent** think aloud protocol to detect problems with MVP assumptions.
          - Prototype developers gain re-susable insights into the users (through the library).
          - Users don't have to think about producing these scalable artifacts (just upload).
          - These files are named with this convention "date_skill_training_user" e.g., "2020_05_13_git_ch1_busy_pi"
     - **Verbalization**
          - User-experience (qualitative MVP tests)
          - This test is the **retrospective** think aloud protocol to detect problems with MVP assumptions.
     - **Learning task performance.**
          - We need **distributed Team PSD users** to _learn at scale._
          - All prototypes are teaching our learners a skill they need to contribute to the team.
          - As we upskill, we continuously integrate prototypes, which scales learning _and_ improvement across Team PSD. 

#### Record Screen (No Audio) 

#### PC User (VA or Non-VA)

#### Non-VA, Windows 10 users only: Record screen using Game DVR

The Game DVR feature can capture any application’s window. 

1. **Press Windows + G** in any application on Windows 10. 
2. **Look for the Game Bar** that will appear. 
3. **Select “Yes, this is a game”** even if the application isn’t a game.

**Reminder:** _Protect your privacy_ and only include information that is relevant for Team PSD prototyping.

#### VA or Non-VA: Record screen using PowerPoint

Powerpoint can has a built-in ability to screencast your desktop and input the video onto a slide in blank powerpoint presentation. 

You can save the video file separately afterwards.

Follow the guide [**here**](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/record-your-screen-in-powerpoint-0b4c3f65-534c-4cf1-9c59-402b6e9d79d0#OfficeVersion=Newer_versions).

1. Follow **steps 1-6** under the header: **Record from your computer screen and embed the recording in PowerPoint.**
2. **VA Machine User**: Your PowerPoint Version on your VA machine will be able to screencast with the instructions in the guide above.
3. **Non-VA Machine User**: Be sure to check your PowerPoint versions as this only works in *PowerPoint for Microsoft 365, PowerPoint 2019, PowerPoint 2016, PowerPoint 2013.*

**Reminder:** _Protect your privacy_ and only include information that is relevant for Team PSD prototyping.

#### Mac User (Usually Non-VA)

#### Record any window on your Mac.

1. **Press Shift-Command-5**. The _Onscreen Controls_ will appear.
2. Once the _Onscreen Controls_ appear, click on one of the buttons with the record circle in the bottom right (4th icon from the left - **Record Entire Screen** or 5th icon from the left - **Record Selected Portion**)
3. **Click the down arrow** under _Options_, located next to the record button.
4. Under _Microphone_, **select none** to turn off audio recording.
5. Under _Options_ in the _Onscreen Controls,_ **adjust the recording window,** setup a _Timer_, and where to _Save To_ your recording.
