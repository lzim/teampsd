The Team PSD Manual's table of contents is clickable and separates into 3 header styles:

- Main Chapter
- Subchapter
- Subheader (nested within Subchapter)

### Main Chapter

Example: This chapter is chapter 2, Use this Manual.

### Subchapter

Example: This subchapter is 2.1, Click on Table of Contents.

### Subheader

Example: This chapter's subheaders are 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.3 which focuses on the 3 different header styles.

Note: Subheaders are nested within subchapters and not directly seen unless the subchapter is first clicked on.
