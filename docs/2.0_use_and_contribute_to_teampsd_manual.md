The Team PSD Manual's table of contents is clickable and separates into 3 header styles:

- Main Chapter
- Subchapter
- Subheader (nested within Subchapter)

### Main Chapter

Example: This chapter is chapter 2, Use this Manual.

### Subchapter

Example: This subchapter is 2.1, Click on Table of Contents.

### Subheader

Example: This chapter's subheaders are 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.3 which focuses on the 3 different header styles.

- Naming convention: chapter_(chapter # here)_(title of your chapter).md
    - Example: chapter_4_teampsd_monthly_process.md

- Note: If your chapter is very long, break down your markdown file into sectioned markdown files to easily find the section of the chapter you want to edit.

### 3.	Edit/format your markdown file.

- Header 3 (hidden unless Header 2 is clicked on in the manual): Sub-level for the main section.
- Header 4 (hidden within the content of Header 3): Use to further indicate additional sections/sub-headings within a chapter.

Example:

- The "bookdown.yml" prints out the manual in the order of the the markdown files listed in line 6 ```rmd_files:```.

- Add your markdown file name in the order of which the file should appear in the manual in line 6 within the brackets.
    - Make sure to include quotations around the file name and a comma, if needed.

This is a great way to check the formatting and output of your markdown file in the actual Manual before you hand off the review for QA Test.

### 5.	Check your file against the GH Actions by making a pull request to the GH-Pages master branch.
- Assign QA Test reviewers and check for a red X by each GH Action and read the output of where errors occurred.
   - Click on "Details" in the ActionChecker Action to be navigated to the Spell, Link, and Linter checkers.
