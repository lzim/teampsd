# Team PSD 2.0 Monthly Process

As Team PSD continues to grow, our workflow alongside team values in order to better support the needs of our team, just like how we developed
[_Modeling to Learn_](https://mtl.how) to scale nationally in the Veterans Health Administration.

The **participatory learning** principles we scaled in _Modeling to Learn_ are:

- equitable access to resources
- mutual learning
- shared decision-making

**Team PSD 2.0** is about becoming more scalable due to continuous integration, deployment and documentation.

- We aim for a completely free, accessible, transparent and reproducible workflow (aka **“open science”**).
- **Our mission** to improve how healthcare quality improvement decisions are made enlists diverse team members and partners.
- We want to **empower** effective contributions from all potential stakeholders.

The Team PSD 2.0 Monthly Process is based on the design thinking principles of **user experience**, which attempts to account for a **person's needs**, **pain points**, **goals**, and **emotional experience** when using a **product/service** and/or going through a **process** and **system**.

**Team PSD 2.0 Process for monthly sprints/epics:**

**Week 1:** Gather user-centered hypotheses

**Week 2:** Clarify user assumptions w/ Minimum Viable Product (MVP) test

**Week 3:** Review results of user persona testing of your MVP Prototype (with concurrent video and retrospective verbal)

**Week 4:** Review user persona artifacts and second story perspectives mindfully and empathically to discover new understandings you might have missed or still need to learn

Our monthly **process for each monthly sprint/epic** is based on the **process for design thinking**:

## Week 1: Gather User Hypotheses

In week 1, we want to gather the user centered hypotheses of the user/user group that we want to help and design for either by meeting with them and/or referring to their user personas.

Hypotheses should consist of the user's needs, pain points, and consider the background and context of the user.

*Week 1 follows the **first phase of the process for design thinking** which involves the ability to **empathize** with the user's current state of experience.*

**Empathize** - To gain an empathic understanding of the need or problem you are trying to solve in terms of people, **processes** that set aside individual **assumptions** to get insight into the need.

- **What?** Details of what to do (what happened).
- This is when we **analyze** observe and document details that relate to users.
- **How?** How the person does it (effort, etc.)
- **Why?** Motivations/purpose (test this out...)

**Exercises for assumptions** (remember: everything is a perspective):

- **List assumptions**
- **Ask**: How could this not be true?
- **Ask**: What if we could do this twice as well in half the time?

**Example of a User Persona:**

## Week 2: Clarify User Assumptions w/ MVP test

In week 2, we want to narrow down the week 1 user centered hypotheses by clarifying assumptions based on those hypotheses.

Assumptions the designer has based on week 1 hypotheses should clarified to **define** only the most crucial and necessary needs and pain points that will be addressed **before prototyping a minimum viable product (MVP)**. This will prevent creating/designing for needs that **do not solve 80% of the user's pain points with only 20% effort** being used in the development of the MVP and test and **quickly rule out MVPs** that do not respond to needs of the users in a **fast and cheap** manner.

*Week 2 follows the **2nd phase of the process for design thinking** which involves the ability to **define** with the user's specific set of problems that needs to be immediately addressed.*

**Define the problem** - This is when we **synthesize** observations into holistic **point of view** (POV).

**Goal is to make linkages, so that we define the right problem to address.**

[Example POV: Busy, nationally distributed, cross-functional team of scientists has many partners, is about to hire more people, leads a national participatory system dynamics simulation learning program in, and is gaining increasing national and international interest in partnership HMW...]

**A problem statement:** Focuses on

- **Specific peopleʼs needs** (not the technology or specs),
- **Value and insights for the project** (not the technical requirements), yet it is...
- ...narrow enough to be **managed within our constraints**

**Exercises for definitions with how-why/why-how laddering** (a variant of **5 whys** principle):

- Asking **"Why?"** Explores to understand **root causes** (abstract, more common across people)
- ...then **“How might we?”** to get to a **specific** problem/challenge we can solve (concrete)

**Part I** - The HMW Brainstorm...HMW

- use the efficiency of GitHub [good]
- remove the [bad] steep learning curve
- integrate with existing GH norms the best part [explore the opposite]
- remove reliance on training [question the assumption]
- go after adjectives [make it easy, instead of hard]
- use code instead of by hand [leverage unexpected resource]
- enable self-directed learning like “Googling” [analogy from need/context]
- attract help from Forio, MITRE, VA to solve this [shift POV against the challenge]
- get it up and running now [shift a status quo]
- divvy up chunks for each workgroup [break up POV]

**Part II**- Why?

“**Why** do we need to integrate our manuals, workflows and processes on GitHub to achieve Team PSD values? (if start with Why, phrase as a need and make it meaningful.”

Because...

“**How** do we use manuals, workflows and process on GitHub now?”

- [describe]
- **"Why?"**
- **“Why?”**

What what was most **surprising**?
What would we have **missed** if we hadnʼt asked why?
