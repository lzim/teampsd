# Week 4: Review Second Story Perspectives

In week 4, your **prototype and MVPs should be able to be fully incorporated into Team PSD's workflow** as we **do NOT** want to spend time developing solutions that do not solve 80% of our team's needs and utilizing only 20% effort in order to fail fast and fail cheap by quickly ruling out assumptions and solutions that do not work.

*Week 4 follows the **last phase of the process for design thinking** which involves the ability to **review tests** of your MVP and **reflect** on those tests that can help you even better mindfully and empathize with users, ultimately to further improve your skills for month's design process.*

**Test** - Review tests your prototype with the user personas in question & look for 2nd story perspectives.

- Does the prototype address the personas needs and pain points?
- What could we have missed or ignored from the user?
- What worked well in the month and what did not?

## Reflect Second Stories

**Use these set of question to help think through Second Story Perspective Questions to reflect on the design process from the month:**

- Do you see any places where moving forward independently could have been more aligned with the team or integrated better when you were done?
- Could a dependency or root assumption have been caught any sooner for the benefit of the team?
- Have you discovered a new empathic understanding of the situation from another users' POV (point of view)?
