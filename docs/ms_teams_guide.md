## Additional Tips/Functions

### VA Teams WebApp Browser:

Click on the Teams WebApp shortcut on your CITRIX remote log-in desktop to access the browser version as CITRIX does not have the desktop version installed.

If you do not see the WebApp shortcut, open Google Chrome and type in **teams.microsoft.com** to access it manually.

2. Select the **square underneath Desktop** to share your entire laptop's Desktop screen. 

Note: Be wary of any open tabs or browsers you may have open that may contain PHI or personal information that you do not want to share.

3. You will notice a subtle red border outlining your entire desktop screen. 
The red border is only visible to you and not anyone else, hence not pictured here.

TIP: Queue up the window you want to share in advance.
I had already quequed up my Google Chrome Browser in the background, which is now being shared as the default of entire desktop screen.

4. Drag in other window/browsers within the red border to show dual screens.

Here I am showing Google Chrome and Teams:

### Disappeared Meeting

To find a meeting call's screen once you've clicked out of the meeting to look elsewhere on Temas (i.e you needed to respond to a ping, when to look for a link in a discussion thread, etc.):

1. Minimize the Teams browser completely by clicking on the middle (-) button at the top header of the browser:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59668647/89908115-5d04c500-dba2-11ea-9760-4f4ccb648232.png)

2. Go to a new browser or your desktop and the meeting call should appear in the bottom right hand corner:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59668647/89908479-c5ec3d00-dba2-11ea-80d7-fcf6537c7691.png)

Alternative (only applicable to Channel Meetings, not Private 1:1 meetings):

If you remember which Channel the meeting call was in, you can click back into the meeting by 'Joining' in again, this will not show you joining twice as you are just re-joining.
