## Week 3: Review User Results of MVP

In week 3, we want to share our MVPs with the user to collect user feedback.

To collect feedback, users will be participating in 2 Think Aloud protocols: **Concurrent Screencast Video (no audio) and Retrospective Verbal.**

1.  **A Concurrent Screencast Video Think Aloud** requires users to screencast themselves going through the MVP prototype, but without audio so they can focus soley on using the MVP.
2.  **A Retrospective Verbal Think Aloud** occurs after the Concurrent Screencase Video Think Aloud in which users think about how they felt about the MVP, what went wrong, what went right, what was missing, etc and write it up afterwards.

These 2 Think Aloud protocols allows us to leverage both the pros and cons of a Concurrent and Retrospective Think Aloud in which:

- the Concurrent provides an undisturbed recording of the user going through the MVP.
- the Retrospective allows the users to verbalize their thoughts, emotions, and feelings about the MVP.

*Week 3 follows the **3rd and 4th phases of the process for design thinking** which involves the ability to **ideate** MVPs
based on the needs and assumptions of the users and get user feedback on a **prototype** MVP that will solve 80% of the user's 
pain points and needs with only 20% effort.*

3. **Ideate** - Expand the problem space by identifying and testing out elements that would circumvent problems.

- time-limit
- quantity over quality
- no distractions
- no bad ideas

4. **Prototype** - inexpensive, scaled down version with the **key features** to investigate the problem and solution. **Goal is to identify the best possible solution**.

- Solutions are investigated, accepted, improved, re-examined, rejected based on user-experiences.
- Should give much better sense sense of constraints and how users would behave, think, and feels when interaction with it.
