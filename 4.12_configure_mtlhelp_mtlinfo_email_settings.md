1. Add mtl.help@va.gov and mtl.info@va.gov inboxes to Outlook.

**Note:** Default settings on both accounts only show emails for the last year. Once this process is complete, you will receive calendar and email notifications for all inboxes added to your account.

To see emails older than one year, follow the following steps. You will be adding these emails as accounts which is different from adding their inboxes in Step 1 above.

1. Navigate to the File menu (in Outlook) and select Add Account.
2. Enter the email you want to add and select Connect.
3. Wait for the next pop-up window to appear, then select Sign in as current user.
4. You should see a confirmation that the account has been added.
5. Close Outlook.
6. Reopen Outlook; you will now see the newly added email in your Account Information (File > Info).
7. Navigate to Account Settings.
8. Double-click on the email address to modify its settings.
9. Change Exchange Account Settings to download email for the past by clicking on the slider and moving it all the way to the right.
10. Select Next.
11. Click Done.
12. Close Outlook.

You have now configured this inbox to download all past emails.

**Note:** This change may take several days to take effect.
