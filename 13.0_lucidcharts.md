## Organizational Account Setup & Sharing Permissions

1. Email Stacey Park or Jenn Li with your preferred email address to use with Lucid.

2. Once they add you to the TeamPSD LucidChart Org Account, you will get an email invitation.

3. Open the email invitation and follow the steps through to finish setting up your account & password.

4. If you are creating a new document within an existing TeamPSD folder, then it will inherit the share permissions of that folder (i.e. for existing TeamPSD folders, the permissions should already be correct, and any new documents will inherit those share permissions).

5. If you are creating a new document outside of an existing TeamPSD folder or creating a new folder, make sure to share it with the correct groups to ensure everyone can see it.

    a. Hover over the document or folder and click "Share."

    b. In the dropdown with the person & penci icon, make sure the "Edit & Share" permissions are selected.

    c. Start typing the name of the group you want to share to:
       - all_teampsd = all TeamPSD members & partners
       - mtl_teampsd = core TeamPSD members that are active in workgroups
       - mtl_hawaii = MTL Hawaii partners
       - heal = team members who contributed to writing and developing the HEAL grant
