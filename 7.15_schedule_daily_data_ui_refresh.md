**Note:** After you have taken over ownership of a dataset in production or have pushed a change to production, make sure the data refreshes are still scheduled daily for each dataset in the deployment pipeline.

1. Go to the Production workspace.
2. Go to settings for the dataset you want to schedule a refresh for.
3. Under Settings for Data, click the arrow next to Gateway connection. This will turn the Schedule refresh from gray to a black clickable option. Select Schedule refresh once it becomes clickable.
4. Under Schedule refresh, select the 'on' toggle, then request a daily refresh frequency for a time between 1-4 a.m.
5. Select both the Dataset owner and mtl.help@va.gov for 'send refresh failure notifications to'.
