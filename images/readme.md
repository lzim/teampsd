# Image Repository

We store images that support the TeamPSD Manual in this repository. The images can be universally updated from this repo, by replacing the image in the directory using the exact same name.

## Format

For easy reference, format the filename to include the chapter_section_description in the image filename. We prefer the use of .png format files, because they are optimized for the internet. For 508 compatibility, insure there is an image description in your markdown file.
