1. Create a TEST branch off the Master branch in production.
2. Coordinate with PeopleOps to identify the _MTL_ Red & Blue TEST teams.
3. DataDevOps works with PeopleOps to document the new release features and conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT or "TEST") with facilitators/learners.

**TEST on lzim/mtl will be our slow TEST condition for new releases.**
- TEST does need to be current w/Master, so we will create a fresh TEST branch when we begin a TEST condition for a new release.
- TEST will be where the health equity module and other new release work for _MTL_ 4.0 will be tested with TEST teams.

**Note this is distinct from QA on lzim/mtl which is our _fast_ quality assurance process to the master branch.**

In week 3, we want to share our MVPs with the user to collect user feedback.

To collect feedback, users will be participating in 2 Think Aloud protocols: **Concurrent Screencast Video (no audio) and Retrospective Verbal.**

1.  **A Concurrent Screencast Video Think Aloud** requires users to screencast themselves going through the MVP prototype, but without audio so they can focus solely on using the MVP.
2.  **A Retrospective Verbal Think Aloud** occurs after the Concurrent Screencast Video Think Aloud in which users think about how they felt about the MVP, what went wrong, what went right, what was missing, etc and write it up afterwards.

These 2 Think Aloud protocols allows us to leverage both the pros and cons of a Concurrent and Retrospective Think Aloud in which:

- the Concurrent provides an undisturbed recording of the user going through the MVP.
- the Retrospective allows the users to verbalize their thoughts, emotions, and feelings about the MVP.

*Week 3 follows the **3rd and 4th phases of the process for design thinking** which involves the ability to **ideate** MVPs
based on the needs and assumptions of the users and get user feedback on a **prototype** MVP that will solve 80% of the user's 
pain points and needs with only 20% effort.*

3. **Ideate** - Expand the problem space by identifying and testing out elements that would circumvent problems.

- time-limit
- quantity over quality
- no distractions
- no bad ideas

4. **Prototype** - inexpensive, scaled down version with the **key features** to investigate the problem and solution. **Goal is to identify the best possible solution**.

- Solutions are investigated, accepted, improved, re-examined, rejected based on user-experiences.
- Should give much better sense sense of constraints and how users would behave, think, and feels when interaction with it.
