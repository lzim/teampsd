The **V21-Speciality Desktop tends to be ***faster*** and more ***up to date***** than the 1VA-General Desktop.

**Tip: Click on star icon in by the V21-Speciality Desktop icon.**
This will make the desktop appear on your Home page tab so you don't have to navigate to the Desktop tab everytime you sign into Citrix.
