**1. What screen do you have to be on to rename your saved runs in *Modeling to Learn*?"**	

a.	Home Screen, Experiment Maintenance section

b.	The main model tile of whatever simulation module you are using

c.	Expanded Outputs Screen, Save Run

d.	Control Panel in Expanded Outputs Screen  



**2. The last time your clinic team uploaded a dataset to the *Modeling to Learn* Module was 10 months ago. The team should:**

a.	Upload a new dataset and re-run their base case to be sure the model reflects recent clinical trends

b.	Compare their team trends in the data UI to see if there is any change

c.	Go to the Home page, Experiments Maintenance tile and delete any experiments run on the old dataset

d.	The age of the dataset in *Modeling to Learn* really doesn’t matter when running experiments  



**3. In *Modeling to Learn*, what do the experimental sliders in the Experiments section do?** 

a.	The sliders allow the learner to change the values of variables from base case to a higher or lower number to test a hypothesis.

b.	The sliders increase or decrease the number of results charts you will see in the Outputs section.

c.	The sliders reset all the experimental values from the previous simulation runs.

d.	The sliders permit the user to move between their individual world and their team world.  



**4. The units used for Engagement Time, Return Visit Interval (RVI) and Median Engagement Duration in any *MTL* module are:**

a.	Weeks

b.	Months

c.	Years

d.	Days  



**5. A team has just run their first experiment and wants to review the base case compared to the results of that experiment. To which area of the Modeling to Learn module do they have to navigate?**

a.	Outputs section, Expanded Outputs screen, Results Dashboard

b.	Outputs section, Control panel, Our Findings box

c.	Experiments section, Team Data table

d.	Main model tile, Reveal Complexity segment  



**6. When reviewing results in the Outputs section of *Modeling to Learn*, you may see oscillation in the results charts. What decisions by a clinic team may cause “oscillation” in team trends?"**

a. Changes to staffing, referral rates, return to clinic visit intervals, and missed appointments

b. Use of multiple ICD-10 and CPT codes for a single patient and new diagnoses being added to a patient’s electronic health record

c. Changes to SAIL and other quality care measures

d. Reimbursement rates for patient care   



**7. Your team has run the base case. Once you have adjusted the experiment sliders for a new experiment, clicked “Run,” clicked “Save,” and named the run. What are the next two steps a team should take?**

a.	Compare Runs to see the differences between the base case and the current experimental values and record the results in the “Our Findings* box.

b.	Reveal complexity in the main model tile diagram and examine the Team Data table.

c.	Logoff the model and log back in to see the Results Dashboard in the Outputs section.

d.	Go back to the Experiments section and adjust the sensitivity sliders to run another experiment.  



**8. You have been asked to tell the “systems story” for an experiment or “run” in *MTL*. What area of the model will allow you to do this?**

a.	The main model tile featuring the diagram with complexity revealed.

b.	The results dashboard with only the base case run showing on the charts.

c.	The Experiments section with the sensitive sliders adjusted to zero.

d.	The Home page, under the Team Data Menu Maintenance.  



**9. When saving an experiment or a “run” in *Modeling to Learn*, you…:**

a.	Will be prompted to add the names of the variables and the numbers for those variables that were changed for the experiment.

b.	Can make up your own name for any experiment or “run” in *MTL*.

c.	Must ask your team lead to save the run for you.

d.	Don’t need to save experiments; they are automatically saved each time you click on “Run.”  



**10. When the clinic team has run an experiment and the results are not a viable clinical action in the short-term, the team can decide to:**

a.	Reset the model and run a different experiment

b.	Save the run and modify the variables to explore different outcomes

c.	Only answer a

d.	Both a and b are correct
