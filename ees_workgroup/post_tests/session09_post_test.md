**1. Which answer below features the correct list of *Modeling to Learn* user tools?**

a.	mtl.how/data, mtl.how/menu, mtl.how/sim

b.	MTLhow.data/user, MTLhow.menu/user, MTLhow.sim/user

c.	mtldata.com, mtlmenu.com, mtlsim.com

d.	MTL.data.how, MTL.menu.how, MTL.sim.how



**2. When you log in to the simulation user interface for *Modeling to Learn* what steps do you have to take to get into the main model tile to run an experiment?**

a.	Select a World, select the button to Join Current Session and click Play

b.	Select a World, select a button next to one of the models to Start a New Session and Click Play

c.	Select Model Name, click Join Current Session and click Play

d.	Both a and b are correct



**3. The *Modeling to Learn* main model tile has a diagram that features two main variables or “stocks.” What are they?**

a.	Appointments and Patients

b.	Completions and Cohorts

c.	Clinics and Clinicians

d.	New Patients and Existing Patients  



**4. One goal of *Modeling to Learn* is to help the learner gain knowledge about how their VA clinic can use their own data to make team-based care decisions about outcomes that may be observed after running an experiment. The process of describing the outcomes the team expects to observe in an experiment is referred to as…:**

a.	Telling a systems story for that experiment

b.	Describing a modeling to learn experience

c.	Examining the clinic-clinician interaction

d.	Teaching VA modeling metrics  



**5. You have been asked to give verbal instructions to your team lead to run an experiment. What initial series of instructions below would you provide to your team lead?**

a.	Confirm all sliders in the Experiments section are showing zero or base case. Study the system diagram and team data. Decide together what variables our team wants to change or experiment with and what we think will happen when we make changes. Enter text into the “Our Question” and “Our Hypothesis” box. Adjust experiment sliders for the new experiment. Click “Run.”

b.	Enter text into the “Our Question” box. Study the system diagram and team data. Adjust the sliders in the Experiments section. Click “Run.” Enter text into “Our Hypothesis” box and “Our Findings” boxes.

c.	Reveal complexity in the main model tile and adjust the sliders in the Experiments Section to the desired numbers. Click “Run.” Go over to Outputs section and enter text into the “Our Question” box, “Our Hypothesis” box, “Our Findings” box, and “Our Decisions” box. Click “Save.”

d.	Click on “Reset.” Go to Experiments section and examine team data. Adjust the sliders. Click “Run.” Got to the Outputs section and click “Save.”



**6. In one *MTL* session, a clinic team compared their base case to an experiment (called “alternative 1”). On the Results Dashboard in the Outputs section, the charts show a black line and a red line. What do the lines represent?**

a.	Black line represents the current experiment (alternative 1) run and the red line represents the base case.

b.	Black line represents the clinician coding patterns and the red line represents the clinic trends.

c.	Black line represents the black sliders in the model and the red line represents the red sliders in the model.

d.	Black line represents the new patients and the red line represents existing patients.



**7. “We expect that by increasing the return visit interval by 1 week and increasing the target wait time by 1 week we will have more appointments available for a specific service but will have fewer patients completing the service over two years.” This is an example of text that would be entered into:**

a.	The “Our Hypothesis” box in the Outputs section

b.	The “Our Findings” box in the Outputs section

c.	The “Our Decisions” box in the Outputs section

d.	The “Our Question” box in the Outputs section  



**8. Your team wants to compare the base case to results from alternative 1 and alternative 2 experiments. To do this, the team lead will:**

a.	Go to the Outputs section, Control panel, Select Experiment area and click on the drop down boxes to select the experiments your team wants to compare

b.	Go to the Home page, Experiments Maintenance tile and select the two experiments to compare

c.	Go to the main model tile and click on “Reveal Complexity” to see the experiments you will compare

d.	Go to the Experiments section and select the variables you want to compare  



**9. Your team has examined and discussed alternative 1 and alternative 2 experiments compared to the base case and have summarized the impact of the clinic decisions over time. What should the team do next?** 

a.	Describe your team's findings, insights and conclusions from these experiments in the “Our Findings” box in the Outputs section.

b.	Discuss what additional experiments the team might run to achieve its clinical priority.

c.	Adopt all of the changes to clinical practice based on *Modeling to Learn* results.

d.	Both a and b could be next steps for the team.



**10. You have been asked to enter text into a box on the Outputs section that reflects what changes your team is ready to make in clinical practice based on what you learned in the recent experiment. Which box will you choose?**

a.	The “Our Decisions” box in the Outputs section

b.	The “Our Hypothesis” box in the Outputs section

c.	The “Our Findings” box in the Outputs section

d.	The “Our Question” box in the Outputs section
