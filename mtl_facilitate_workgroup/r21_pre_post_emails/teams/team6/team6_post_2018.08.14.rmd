**Team Learning Goal:** Strength in Numbers!  
**Next Meeting:** 8/28 @ 9am  
**Meeting Info:** mtl.how/live | 1-800-767-1750; Code 27379  


As a reminder, we are planning to spend August and September wrapping up Modeling to Learn. Thanks for piloting and learning with us!    
**Wrap Up #1:** Team Reflections and Decisions – Implementing a change in the team based on lessons learned and reflections from the simulation.  
**Wrap Up #2:** Technical Assistance Plans & Resources for Self-Directed Learning – Providing teams with resources, guides, and videos for developing and running future experiments.  
**Booster Sessions (Optional):**  Developing hypothesis and experiments to run in a new module  

Thanks!  
Stacey

### We decided... for all future experiments, the team's baseline in the model is not to work overtime in response to increased work pressure (setting slider to 0).

Done | Do
Explored changing assumptions around overtime and RVI | Experiment with 1) Changing sensitivity of overtime from work pressure and 2) Changing service proportions
