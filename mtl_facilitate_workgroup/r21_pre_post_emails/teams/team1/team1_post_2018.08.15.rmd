## Reschedule 9/5 meeting.  
Normally we would meet tomorrow next on 9/5. However,the TeamPSD facilitators will be in Chicago for MTL Facilitate training. We can reschedule on the ***2nd Wednesday - September 12 @10am*** or meet next at our typical meeting on the ***3rd Wednesday - September 19 @10am***.
Please let us know what would make the most sense for your team.  

As a reminder, we only have two sessions of Modeling to Learn remaining. In those, we will cover:   
**Wrap Up #1:** Team Reflections and Decisions – Implementing a change in the team based on lessons learned and reflections from the simulation.    
**Wrap Up #2:** Technical Assistance Plans & Resources for Self-Directed Learning – Providing teams with resources, guides, and videos for developing and running future experiments.   
**Booster Sessions (Optional):**  Developing hypothesis and experiments to run in a new module   

Thanks for piloting and learning with us!
