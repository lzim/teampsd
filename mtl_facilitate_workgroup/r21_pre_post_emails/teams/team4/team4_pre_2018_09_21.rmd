|**At Our Last Team Meeting**|
| [<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/logos/mtl_how_sim.png" height = "45" width = "65">](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Team Lead ran Experiment 2, we ran a new basecase with fresh data, and MTL 1.6 was introduced.**|
**Experiment 2**
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/question.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/> **Our Question.** *Briefly describe what your team wants to learn from this experiment.*
Reduction in a psychotherapist is our learning question.
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/hypothesis.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/> **Our Hypothesis.** *Outline the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes your team expects to observe.* 
The team makes different decisions according to the service delays (RVI, service proportions), but how much do we think changing service proportions will impact patient care? Which variables will it impact? In our experiment, we adjusted the service proportions for intake (up to 6 new intakes per week), and we adjusted the service proportion of MM up to 50 %. These don't reflect our expectations about impact, as much as they reflect new hypotheses about what is happening in the team with an increase in CBOC referrals to the team.
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/findings.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/> **Our Findings.** *Describe your team's findings, insights and conclusions from this experiment.*
Last time we found that 80% of the service proportions was MM and adjunctive services. We found that it was a gradual decline in patient psychotherapy from 50 to 0 over two years. Look at the y-axes and units, which vary in each graph. The hours for the psychotherapy immediately declined, but the patients in psychotherapy gradually declined. The appointments in hours/week declined from 9/week (today our experimental value) to around 7 hours/week in about 6 months and stays there for up to two years.
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/decisions.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/> **Our Decisions.** *Based on what you learned in this experiment, what changes are you ready to make in your practice?* 
We also adjusted our service proportions to increase intakes, CC and MM, so we should also look at those impacts next. |
