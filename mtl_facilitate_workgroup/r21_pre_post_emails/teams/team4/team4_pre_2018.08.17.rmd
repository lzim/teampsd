**Team Learning Goal:** RESPECT – Really Effectively Streamlining Patients’ Evidence-based Clinical Treatments  
**Next Meeting:** TO BE RESCHEDULED  
**Meeting Info:** mtl.how/live | 1-800-767-1750; Code 27379    

## Reschedule 8/17 meeting tomorrow.
We apologize for the last for the last minute notice!  
Normally we would meet tomorrow 8/17 and next on 9/7. However, all of the TeamPSD facilitators are unavailable to meet tomorrow.
We can reschedule on either the ***4th Friday - August 24 @8am*** or ***5th Friday - August 31 @8am***.  
Please let us know what would make the most sense for your team.  

Also, we are planning to spend the second meetings this month finishing up experiments and using the two meetings in September for wrap up.  
**Wrap Up #1:** Team Reflections and Decisions – Implementing a change in the team based on lessons learned and reflections from the simulation.  
**Wrap Up #2:** Technical Assistance Plans & Resources for Self-Directed Learning – Providing teams with resources, guides, and videos for developing and running future experiments.  
**Booster Sessions (Optional):**  Developing hypothesis and experiments to run in a new module  

Thanks!  
Stacey
