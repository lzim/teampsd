# MTL Facilitate Pre-Session Checklist

## Decide who will be the pre/post prep co-facilitator, who will be the live lead facilitator.

## The week before of the meeting 
### Send Pre Email
1. Send the pre-session team email.

## Day of session Prep Checklist (30 minutes)  
### Pre/Post Co-facilitator
Check the session_resources card at the top of each session column at [mtl.how/team_tracker](mtl.how/team_tracker) for a list of relevant 1) platforms and 2) guides/checklists to prep for each session.

### Live Lead Facilitator (should be done during the post-session debrief and reviewed during the prep meeting)
1. Open the [SEE file](https://mtl.how) at mtl.how for learners.

2. Open the [team_tracker checklist](https://mtl.how/team_tracker) at mtl.how/team_tracker for team details prepped during intersession prep.

3. Divvy up in-session tasks (who will do what e.g., cover the do/done, review the hypothesis from last meeting) with specific time stamps between the two co-facilitators and note these decisions on the [team_tracker checklist](https://mtl.how/team_tracker) for that team.
