## A. Post-Session Debriefing checklist items 1 & 3:

### 1. Time management & trouble-shooting

We achieved _________ (0-100%) of our time stamp marks as planned when we prioritized and practiced during our intersession prep.

### 3. How did the co-facilitation model go? 

**Use the following Likert Scale for the Responses below**
- [ ] 5 Strongly Agree 
- [ ] 4 Agree 
- [ ] 3 Neither Agree nor Disagree 
- [ ] 2 Disagree 
- [ ] 1 Strongly Disagree

**Sessions 5-8 - Rate the following 4 items.** 
- [ ] 1. This project emphasizes what is important to our (this) team.
- [ ] 2. We sought to support our existing capacities to best use local team resources and make local decisions.
- [ ] 3. Even though we did not have total agreement, we did reach a kind of consensus that our (this) team all accepts.
- [ ] 4. We are supporting shared team decision-making in this project.

### 6. What is the team's guiding question and hypotheses? (what are they testing?)

#### BUILD & APPLY (s5-s8) Intersession Checklist Priorities

_CONSIDER THESE QUESTIONS_
- **NEED: Current working conceptualization of this team's need based on the 4 priorities below?**  _______________________________________

- **DIFFERENTIATE: I need to rule in  _______________________________________ or rule out  _______________________________________ during this session to refine my conceptualization and prepare for the next session (based on growing consensus and capacity building with this team).**

- **My GOAL for this session is that the team will document the following Q/H/F/D by end of the session.**

**Question: _______________________________________** 

**Hypothesis: _______________________________________** 

**Findings: _______________________________________** 

**Decisions: _______________________________________** 

1. Specific values from the Team Data table (sessions 2,3 & 5) that are guiding the in-session work to address the team's highest priority need. _______________________________________

2. Complexity reveal (causal loop) most relevant to the team's highest priority need is: _______________________________________

3. Specific value adjustments you expect will be helpful for the team to experiment with related to their highest priority need: _______________________________________ 

**Experiment (Session)** | **Variable(s) & Value(s) in BC** | **Variable(s) and Value Adjustment(s) in Experiment**
-- | -- | -- 
**Exp 1 (s8)** | _______________________________________ | _______________________________________  
**Exp 2 (s9)** | _______________________________________  | _______________________________________
