2. Log into [mtl.how/data](https://mtl.how/data) (Data UI) and to upload any new sim UI team data from the team to the simulation (if necessary).

3. Log into [mtl.how/facilitate (Admin Forio Epicenter)](https://mtl.how/facilitate) to map all facilitators/coders as team leads to the relevant team world. 

4. Log into [mtl.how/sim (Sim UI)](https://mtl.how/sim) to make sure the model file reads into the sim correctly.    

5. Log into [mtl.how/live (Adobe Connect)](https://mtl.how/live) and dial into 1-800-767-1750; Code 27379 (VANTS phone line) to join the meeting.  Assign all facilitators/coders to "presenter" role. 

## Live Lead Facilitator (should be done during the post-session debrief and reviewed during the prep meeting)
1. Check the [session guide (see file)](https://mtl.how), [faciliator guide (say file)](https://mtl.how) and [facilitator say checklist](https://mtl.how) for the session.

2. Check [mtl.how/sim](https://mtl.how/sim) in *team* and *facilitator* roles to review the last team meeting.

3. [Check the co-facilitator debriefing notes from the last team meeting.](https://mtl.how/team_tracker)

4. Check the [systems thinking codebook](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/tree/master/qual_workgroup/qual_codebooks/systems_thinking) to prepare notes that target a new dimension or level systems thinking improvement on team question, hypothesis, findings, and decisions for discussion.

# Prep together pre-session |
1. Divvy up in-session tasks - who will do what (e.g., cover the do/done, review the hypothesis from last meeting).

2. Review target time stamps for the session - what will you cover by when in the meeting.

3. Review the targeted next level of systems thinking in the question, hypothesis, findings and decisions boxes for that session.
