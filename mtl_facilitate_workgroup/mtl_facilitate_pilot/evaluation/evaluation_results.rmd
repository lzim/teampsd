1. Of the 24 hours spent in the Modeling to Learn Facilitate Pilot, rate the amount of time spent on each of the items below:
    1. Data UI
    
   <img src =  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/mtl_facilitate_workgroup/mtl_facilitate_pilot/evaluation/evaluation_plots/data_ui.png>

    <img src =  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/mtl_facilitate_workgroup/mtl_facilitate_pilot/evaluation/evaluation_plots/sim_ui.png>

    <img src =  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/mtl_facilitate_workgroup/mtl_facilitate_pilot/evaluation/evaluation_plots/facilitation_guide_resources.png>

Other comments on this question: 
- As we discussed, perhaps w/some Pre-orientation, it would have been easier to 'get' the data interface. But for now, I would have liked to have spent more time on it.  Would have liked the facilitator guides ahead of time to use along w/the training.
- As mentioned in our comments during the training, more up front orientation to the Facilitator Guide would have been helpful.
- As we touched on, it would have been helpful to have the facilitation guides up front.   Sim UI: more time to play would be helpful, but it was a good intro/baseline 
- Not sure that this could be adjusted within the 24 hour time frame but also not sure that it should be.  May be worth an expectation to 'play' at home and come back after the 24 hours of training rather than adding in classroom time.

    1. Session 1: Team Vision
    
    <img src =  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/mtl_facilitate_workgroup/mtl_facilitate_pilot/evaluation/evaluation_plots/receptivity_session1.png>

    <img src =  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/mtl_facilitate_workgroup/mtl_facilitate_pilot/evaluation/evaluation_plots/receptivity_session8.png>

Other comments on this question:
- I think it depends on the front line staff. i think it is still very high level and would be challenging for front line staff to comprehend. 
- I think the teams will feel like they've already defined their values and their needs, BUT,  after going through the model together, I think this will be valuable (but the buy in and connection to why these steps have value will be necessary to underscore for sufficient buy-in)

Other comments on this question:
- I rated these low only because it took us a while to get through these as we're learning. i would imagine depending on the team it would be challenging to get through some of these difficult concepts in an hour
- Not sure how the timing would go, as there will be different specific questions/needs within each team.
- Some are rated as neutral because there will be significant variability in prior knowledge and potentially openness among the sites.
- I think once I am more comfortable with the tool and processes, I would definitely feel those I rated as neutral would be do-able in an hour. In my current state, I don't feel as confident. I think that the individual worlds will be very useful for exploration and I think this will allow for the hour time frame to be accomplished.
- Tough to answer until I have greater facility with the material and some experience with facilitating.  Tried to think of the facilities/clinics with whom I work as a basis for the answers.

Other comments on this question:
- Good representatiion 
- I think the care coordination piece would still benefit from clarification in terms of conceptual implementation.  I think another piece that is important to consider is the definition differences in items like 'course of treatment,' 'cohort,' etc.

5. Please estimate your Pre-level of systems thinking about EBP reach and clinic staff decisions on the four domains:
    1. Complexity
    2. Feedback
    3. Behavior

Other comments on this question:
- I tend to be predisposed to systems thinking and approaches - it is what drew me to this position and has kept it interesting.  This approach, however, pushes that to a different level.

Other comments on these questions:
- I'm very interested in getting this going in VISN 12. 
- Data tools are so cool and so easy to access.   I am highly interested in learning more and feel like i would need to learn more in order to feel like the applicability would be highest possible across all areas.
- Answers based on my expectations of impact/interest to the field - actual experience yet to be gained...

14. The greatest value of Modeling to Learn to learners is (check all that apply):
- Team focused approach
- Shared decision making
- Equitable access to resources
- Mutual learning
- Transparent data
- Systems thinking skills

Other comments on this question: 
- I think initially you will get the strongest positive reaction to the data transparency. This is going to be a game changer for a lot of front line staff.  Many of them already work in a team-based format, albeit in possibly less formalized teams (they work in their smaller groups to get the work done). I think this, plus the systems thinking are really important components of the process and change but will take a little longer to achieve the awareness of the value for some of our teams. 
-----

15. Please indicate which of the following characteristics are of benefit to you as a technical assistant specialist (check all that apply):

 - Enhanced ability to address an important issue
 - Development of new skills
 - Heightened profile with my institution
 - Increased utilization of my expertise or services
 - Acquisition of useful knowledge about services, programs, or people in the VA
 - Enhanced ability to affect policy
 - Development of valuable relationships
 - Enhanced ability to meet the needs of my constituency or clients at the VA
 
Other comments on this question: 
- None

16. Based on your impression of Modeling to Learn so far, how would you characterize the benefits of participating in a partnership between TAS and TeamPSD compared to the drawbacks?

 Benefits greatly exceed the drawbacks
 Benefits exceed the drawbacks
 Benefits and drawbacks are about equal
 Drawbacks exceed the benefits
 Drawbacks greatly exceed the benefits

Other comments on this question:
- As discussed, the primary barrier/challenge to our participation will be our team having the bandwidth to do this.
-----

17. Rate TeamPSD's level of effectiveness in each of these areas:
    1. Preparation
    2. Facilitation
    3. Command of the subject
    4. Responsiveness to learners
    
Other comments on this question:
- Prepared and very responsive 
-----

18. Rate the level of effectiveness of the Modeling to Learn program in the following:
    1. Shared decision making
    2. Equitable access to resources
    3. Mutual learning
    
Other comments on this question:
- I think mutual learning is high but will be variable 
-----

19. Describe the best way to become prepared to facilitate Modeling to Learn Live...
- I would like information described at debrief, as much information ahead of time as possible
- Prework
- Practice/play with data  Observe a full facilitation cycle
- Co-facilitation with a PSD Team member will be invaluable.
- All of the things we highlighted in our debrief would add to the preparation. 
- Some additional prereadings would help.

20. Now that you have experienced the Modeling to Learn Facilitate Pilot, what sequencing and content changes would you suggest to the 12-session plan (one hour every two weeks)?
- I'd have to think about this more, but wondering if 12 sessions may be too long to keep a team engaged 
- Provide prework, facilitator guides ahead of time 
- Sequencing makes sense
- As discussed in our meeting, an earlier overview of the full MTL process would be very helpful.
- We discussed this in detail during our debrief, will keep thinking on this and will send additional thoughts if any occur to me
- Content is good - may also consider some additional recall information (though with real practice each time, that might suffice)

21. What are the biggest challenges you foresee for yourself in facilitating Modeling to Learn Live effectively?
- I think it is still very high level and would be difficult for line staff to understand, i would recommend making it less high level. I think teaching systems thinking is challenging alone 
-. Dedicated time
- Time!
- Time
- Confidence in my knowledge of the model and dexterity with the tools. 
- Both initial and ongoing clear familiarity with the materials and the underlying mechanisms that derive data definitions and the models themselves.
