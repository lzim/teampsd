# *MTL* Blue 12-session Plan

## Session Summaries and Learning Objectives across *MTL* Modules

session 01. Today we're *modeling to learn* how to align our **team vision**. 
1.	Describe your own vision for what you would like your team to get from *Modeling to Learn*.
2.	Test out your thinking with your team about what your shared vision is for becoming a "dream team."
3.	Identify a shared team vision for learning from *Modeling to Learn*.

session 02. Today we're *modeling to learn* how to check our **patient data** and **team trends.**
1.	Describe the decisions your team made in producing your team data table.
2.	Test whether team historical trends shown in the "viz" tabs reflect your expectations.
3.	Apply your clinical expertise to identify new information about a team patient in the "data" tabs.

session 03. Today we're *modeling to learn* how to produce **team data** for simulation.
1.	Describe your team trends over the last two years based on the estimates in the team data.
2.	Test your understanding of how the team data are estimated by reviewing descriptions and definitions.
3.	Apply your clinical expertise to consider the team trends in the data UI and team data to identify team priorities for learning.

session 04. Today we're *modeling to learn* how to prioritize **team needs**.
1.	Describe the high priority needs reported across the team.
2.	Test out how these needs are experienced across the team through team dialogue.
3.	Consider the team vision and apply team decision-making to select a high-priority module of *MTL*.

session 05. Today we're *modeling to learn* how to log-in to our **team world**.
1.	Describe the team data in the Experiments section.
2.	Test out the simulation user-interface for more information about team data.
3.	Apply clinical expertise to consider the decisions the team makes that affect these variables.

session 06. Today we're *modeling to learn* how to tell a **systems story**.
1.	Describe the systems story of your team's highest priority.
2.	Test out your thinking about causes of team challenges using the model diagram.
3.	Apply clinical expertise to develop a question for team learning using simulation.

session 07. Today we're *modeling to learn* how to evaluate our **base case** of no new decisions.
1.	Describe the base case of no new decisions in your team.
2.	Test out your thinking about what is likely to cause oscillation in team trends.
3.	Apply systems thinking to develop a hypothesis about your team's clinical priority.

session 08. Today we're *modeling to learn* how to test a **dynamic hypothesis**.
1.	Describe the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes you expect to observe in your experiment.
2.	Test your dynamic hypothesis about your team's clinical priority.
3.	Apply systems thinking to describe your team's findings, insights, and conclusions from your experiment.

session 09. Today we're *modeling to learn* how to **compare alternatives**.
1.	Describe the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes you expect to observe in your experiment.
2.	Test your dynamic hypothesis about your team's clinical priority.
3.	Apply systems thinking to describe your team's findings, insights and conclusions from your experiment.

session 10. Today we're *modeling to learn* how to use **systems thinking**.
1.	Describe the decisions you experimented with and how they are intertwined with other decisions and clinic outcomes over time.
2.	Test your understanding of the causal system story by describing what’s happening when it produces a system behavior over time.
3.	Apply your thinking to anticipate the short- and long-term trends in your team’s care quality under different decision scenarios.

session 11. Today we're *modeling to learn* how to make **future team decisions**.
1.	Describe what your team has prioritized as decisions to implement in your clinic.
2.	Test your team's plan against your individual and shared team vision.
3.	Apply your team's plan in clinical decisions using C.F.B.T. systems thinking.

session 12. Today we're *modeling to learn* how to turn **team learning** into a **team plan**.
1.	Describe what your team has learned throughout the MTL 12-session program.
2.	Test out with each other how your new practice decisions based on systems thinking align with your team’s shared vision.
3.	Apply the new decisions that your team has prioritized.
