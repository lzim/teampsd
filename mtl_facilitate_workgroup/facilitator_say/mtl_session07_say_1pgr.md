# [MTL Live Session 07](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/mtl_facilitate_workgroup/mtl_live_guide/mtl_live_session06_see.Rmd "MTL Live Session 06")

## Today we're modeling to learn how to evaluate our Base Case of no new decisions.
- [ ]  Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________. Today we're modeling to learn how to evaluate our Base Case of no new decisions.

## Navigate to the SEE guide to show Done and Do
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:00-00:10** 
- [ ] <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/done.png" height = "40" width = "40">  Done: We logged in to our individual world at mtl.how/sim. We entered in our own hypothesis about the Base Case in the Text section.
- [ ] <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/do.png" height = "45" width = "45"> Do: We will run a "BC" simulation and review the impact of **making no new decisions** on ________________ in the MTL sim UI Outputs section.

## Emphasize team priority with the learning objectives on the screen 
- [ ] <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/learning_objectives.png" height = "45" width = "45"> **Learning Objectives for Session 7**
1. Describe the base case of no new decisions in your team. 
2. Test out your thinking about what is likely to cause **oscillation** in team trends. 
3. Apply **systems thinking** to develop a hypothesis about your team's clinical priority. 

## Start in-session exercise and provide rationale for running a base case with no new decisions. 
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:10-00:15 - Team-specific rationale** __________________
- [ ] <img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/illustrations/data_ui_sim_ui.png" height = "50" width = "150"> Provide **rationale** for preparing for running a base case of no new decisions prior to running simulation experiments.
- [ ] The first step in learning from simulation is to run a **base case simulation** against which all **future experiments** will be compared.   

## Team lead shares Chrome and logs in to the Team world at **mtl.how/sim**
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:15-00:20 - Team's Session 06 Question** __________________
- [ ] Join current session to pick up where the team left off in Session 06.
- [ ] Orient to main page: Team name, module, and selected data file.
- [ ] Navigate to the team's Session 06 question.

## Creating a Base Case question and hypothesis related to our team making no new decisions
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:20-00:30 - Team Priority**__________________ 
- [ ] Provide rationale for creating a **team question and hypothesis** related to a BC with no new decisions. 
- [ ] Example question: What happens to ____________ (from the team's priority) if we make no new decisions? 
- [ ] Example hypothesis: Outline the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes your team expects to observe (AGG, CC, MM, PSY, or SP)
- [ ] Input our team's BC question and hypothesis into the Text box.
- [ ] Continue to describe the **causal loop** most relevant to the team's highest priority need. 

## Running the Base Case of no new decisions
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:30-00:40  - Team Priority**__________________
- [ ] Set all **experiment sliders** to **"bc" or "zero"** except **purple sliders**, which start with a default value of **"1"**.
- [ ] Hit "Run"!
- [ ] Go to the Expanded Outputs section and **Save** (without resetting) our run. 

## Practice describing specific output charts related to the team's highest priority need using Base Case data
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:40-00:50 - Team Priority**__________________
- [ ] Look at the results with the **team specific to the team's question and hypothesis** for the BC run.
- [ ] What does the team notice about the results related to their highest priority need? 
- [ ] Describe team findings in the *Our Findings* textbox, and explain how the findings relate to the team's question and hypothesis. 
- [ ] Based on what the team learned in this base case experiment, what does the team want to try next? 
- [ ] Record next steps in the *Our Decisions* textbox to help guide future experiements. 

## Have Team Lead pull up the session 06 SEE guide Done/Do review.
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:50-00:55**  
- [ ] Done: We entered our Question, Hypothesis, Findings and Decision for our Base Case (bc) in the Text section.
- [ ] Do: Log into mtl.how/sim and explore the results of the BC run in the Results Dashboard of the Expanded Outputs section to prepare for experiment 1. 
- [ ] Demo for team how to reload team's prior Question, Hypothesis, Findings and Decision. 
- [ ] Reminder to click "Save" and log out.
